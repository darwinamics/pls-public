    123internetservices.com, including all subscribers to lists or newsletters,
    whether paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or unpaid,
    and all customers or clients. Persons who visit or view this Website whether
    intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or unsolicited, are
    described herein as “User” and are parties to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    By using any Website maintained by 1-2-3 Internet Services, LLC, you agree
    to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Because we gather certain types of
    information about and from you, we believe it is important that you
    understand our collection and use of this information. This Privacy Policy
    discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or
    change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided

  <h3 class="bodypol__h3--pp">1.2.1 Types of Data Collected</h3>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">Personally Identifiable Information</p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    As a general policy, no Personally Identifiable Information is automatically
    collected from your visit to the Website, but it will be collected if
    provided by you or received by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    Information You Volunteer. We collect the Personal Information you and
    others knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Website. For
    example, we collect the Personal Information you submit when you register
    with this Website, participate in a contest or survey, sign up for our
    newsletters, comment on a news item, or contact us with questions.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We collect information that is
    sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically
    includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider,
    the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your
    browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. Please
    check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends
    or how to change your settings. Generally, we do not link the information
    provided by your browser to your Personal Information.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    More About IP Addresses. An “IP address” is a unique number that is
    automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. It
    is used to identify your computer’s “location” in cyberspace, so that the
    information you request can be delivered to you. IP addresses do not include
    your name, e-mail address, or other information that identifies you
    personally, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you. For
    example, if you have registered with this Website, we may link your IP
    address to account information that identifies you personally. We may also
    provide your IP address to our third-party service providers who can use it
    to identify your state and zip code. This gives us valuable demographic
    information about the individuals who use this Website. In addition, if, we
    suspect fraud or a threat to the security of this Website, we may share our
    server logs—which contain users’ IP addresses —with the appropriate
    investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and
    identify individuals.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">Cookies and Similar Technologies.</p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    We use “cookies” and other Web technologies (such as clear gifs, web beacons
    or similar devices) to collect information and support certain features of
    this Website. For example, we may use these technologies to:
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    collect information about the ways visitors use this Website—which pages
    they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    to support the features and functionality of this Website—for example, to
    save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database or
    to prompt the settings you established on previous visits; and
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    to personalize your experience when you use this Website.
  </p>
  <p class="bodypol__p--pp">
    Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not
    identify you personally. If, however, you volunteer your identity, for
    example, by emailing us, we may link the information we collect using these
    Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally, use
    such third party information to enhance the information we collect using
    these web technologies, and/or provide access to or share the information we
    collect with third parties, including but not limited to data vendors,
    business partners, affiliates and clients. Generally, if you do not wish to
    receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you

    access to User’s information. Merchant service providers do not allow us
    access to user’s credit card information.
